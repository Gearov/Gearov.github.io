  Welcome, user. The time is now <time datetime="2015-03-04T22:01:58-08:00">22:01</time>. Here you can learn about the purpose of this archive, as well as the significance of the various metadata tags used on various archive entries. Also, you can learn about those whose work helped assist in the creation of the archive.
</p>

<p>Welcome to the Forgotton Technician’s Notebook. This is my third blog, after using Livejournal in the late 90’s and moving on to blogger somewhere in the aughts. I’m hoping to make this one stick. One major change is that this one has been built by me, using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole</a>. I feel like I have a better understanding of the software running my blog, and have modified it to my purposes. Additionally, should I ever decide I want to switch blog providers, it’s easy to do. I own the software infrastructure, and the hardware’s just a detail. More than with my previous blogs, I feel like I really -own- this one.</p>

<p>The flipside of that is that I am missing out on a lot of infrastructure benefits that both Blogger and LiveJournal had, such as followers and a proper comments section. I’m considering Disqus or Discourse, but… eh. Managing internet communities and comment sections is not strongly appealing to me.</p>

<p>This blog has a few purposes. One, it’s a great place to vent my opinions out of my head. Thus freed of them, my mind will hopefully be able to flow more freely. Also, teaching. I have shied away from teaching in my past blogs, because I feel that a lot of what I could have to say has been said better by more intelligent people elsewhere. This is still true, but teaching has a benefit for me as well. If I can teach it, I know it. So the purpose of my teaching is less to serve as a benefit for others, but more as a benefit for myself.</p>

<h2 id="metadata-tags">Metadata Tags</h2>

<p>Each one of the tags I use, I use for a specific purpose.</p>

<ul>
<li>Math
<p>Hah! This one primarily exists to try and encourage me to teach some math. It's not going to happen.</p>
</li>

<li>Code
<p>Unlike the math tag, the code tag will probably get used, either to teach code or to talk about code or to talk about software engineering in general.</p>
</li>

<li>Shadowrun
<p>Shadowrun is one of my favorite settings, and I'm hoping to post some of the work I'm doing to hopefully make its rule mechanics better.</p>
</li>

<li>Story
<p>Ideally, I would probably have a seperate tumblr to post my fanfic and other awful stories to. Failing that, I figure I can alienate some readers here.</p>
</li>

<li>Opinion
<p>This one's actually really important. I have a lot of opinions. They're a burden, and frankly, kind of useless. I am hoping that by posting them here, to this blog, to free myself of them. Get them out into the open internet, and then I don't need to think them anymore; after all, they're right there. My opinions are unsubstantiated and probably wrong. You can ignore this tag.</p>
</li>

<li>Question
<p>Sometimes I answer questions in-character for the amusement of my friends. This was primarily meant to be a Facebook activity, but since Facebook is a bit of an archival mess and I don't like it anyway, some of those question and answer posts will wind up here. Also, Facebook is kind of a short-form format. Some of the questions were so good, I kind of want to grow them out. Here, they can be as large as they need to be and nobody who matters will mind.</p>
</li>

<li>Frontier
<p>I have this sci-fi universe idea that's been bouncing around in my head off and on for what seems like forever. I was originally just going to shove this under the story tag, but decided it deserves its own space. Besides, quite a few posts from my old blogs needed to be transferred over. Hate to let all that go to waste.
</p>
</li>

<li>Void
<p>Sometimes there just doesn't seem to be a proper category.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>

<p>Without these people and their willingness to share their work on the internet, my blog would be a flaming wreck.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Joshua Lande (<a href="http://twitter.com/joshualande">@joshualande</a>): Looking at his work got me started on this mess. My Archive.Bin history page cribs heavily from his work <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Charlie Park (<a href="http://twitter.com/charliepark">@charliepark</a>): I borrowed some of his CSS for my tagging metawrapper. <a href="http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/">This</a> post of his helped start me on my way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Joe Kampschmidt (<a href="http://twitter.com/jokecamp">@jokecamp</a>): Ultimately, his approach to tags led to how they’re implemented in the Archive.Bin, and what really made Jekyll tags ‘click’ in my mind, leading to my current implementation. <a href="http://www.jokecamp.com/blog/listing-jekyll-posts-by-tag/">This</a> post is what led to what the archive-by-tag page looks like today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stephan Groß (<a href="http://twitter.com/minddust">@minddust</a>): The idea to manually make pages for my tags, from <a href="http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Have questions or suggestions? Right now the best thing to do is probably <a href="https://twitter.com/gearov">bother me on Twitter</a>, though I make no promises.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
