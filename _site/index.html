    <p>There’s two broad ways to think about how to obtain sublight travel. The first is the obvious way that humanity has been using since we first aimed for the stars - reaction drives. Basically, you have your rocket, and you throw some mass in a direction. In a frictionless environment with no other forces involved, your rocket must travel in a direction opposite that of where you threw your mass. Basically a long rewording of the Newton law that every action must have an equal and opposite reaction. Conveniently, there are many ways to achieve this goal. Rockets, ion engines, and photon engines.</p>

    <p>As a space opera setting, Frontier needs to have the tools available for its wayward characters to traverse the stars reasonably freely. After all, one of the themes is exploring strange new worlds, which isn’t going to mean much if we can’t get our characters to those strange new worlds in question! However, here we hit a snag, depending on how ‘hard’ we want the science in our setting to be. For those who don’t know, ‘hardness’ in a science fiction setting refers to how scientifically plausible it is. Settings which stick to slight iterations on current technology and use rocket propulsion for space travel are considered to be ‘harder’ than settings which hand wave away gross details of amazing teleportation and feats of incredible engineering. A TVTropes entry (link) goes into more detail than I will here. For those who went and read that, though ( sorry for the time sink! I’m sure you’ll escape TVTropes eventually! ), the aim for Frontier is to try for a three, be happy to settle for a two, and avoid a one on the hardness scale that TVTropes is using.</p>

    <p>So in a recent discussion, the topic of science fiction came up, and my friends and I discussed many many sci-fi series as well as their flaws. In the course of this discussion, I was reminded of a science fiction setting that I have been developing on and off since I was a young teenager. With this nudge of encouragement, and my mind filled once more with imaginary tales, I went and pulled out the notes I’ve made over the years developing this alternative world. As I did so, however, this time I paused and pondered a deeper question on the matter that I’d not considered in some time.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of this project?</p>

    <p>I was asked by someone about my workspace. So, this is kind of an opinion piece. My way is certainly not the One True Way to set up a coding environment, and shouldn’t be taken as such. Hell, even for -me- it’s not a One True Way. It’s possibly not even a -Better- way. It’s just a way that lets me get things done without wanting to punch the machine.</p>

    <p>It’s only taken me ten plus years, but I’ve finally nailed down how I absolutely, positively make sure I’ve learned something.</p>

<p>If I can’t teach it, and I’m not using it, then I have not truly learned it. I have often learned things well -enough-, to be able to perform adequately. But unless I’ve made some attempt to explain what I’ve learned to someone else, I find that the lesson is not as deep, and not as wide, either.</p>
