Shadowrun is a child of the eighties, and its themes reflect that. How strongly these themes are emphasized or not emphasized in any given edition varies, but the themes are still definitely born of the 80's era of cyberpunk. The timeline is set in the near future, and the set pieces always include body and mind modifications. The megacorporations tower over all aspects of future-modern life, outweighing governments in influence, and yet much more distant. There's a certain amount of resource-starvation (as evidenced by the necessity of soy as a staple food). And there is a strong counter-cultural element,those who would fight the systems in place, exemplified by the eponymous Shadowrunners. The classical Shadowrunner is a person who exists on the outside of main culture, a non-person as far as the controlling powers-that-be are concerned.
