I was asked by someone about my workspace. This is kind of an opinion piece. My way is certainly not the One True Way to set up a coding environment, and shouldn't be taken as such. Hell, even for -me- it's not a One True Way. It's possibly not even a -Better- way. It's just a way that lets me get things done without wanting to punch the machine.

So, first, platform. If I'm on a Linux box, my work gets done at the command line, all the time every time. I still prefer to have a GUI with a desktop and graphical applications so I can Google for something real fast or distract myself for a few hours with that neat marble game, but actual coding work will be done at the terminal. I'm fond of Ubuntu's tabbed-capable terminal. I'll almost always make that sucker super big, make a tab, get one tab to where I want to be in the file system and the other one will be used to run my current editor of choice. For most languages, I'll use vim. If I'm coding in Common Lisp, I'll use emacs, simply because the emacs/SLIME combination is, for my purposes, extremely hard to beat.

On Mac, I use a hybrid approach. I'll have the terminal open to where I suspect I'm going to be doing a lot of compiling and running of code. For actual editing, well, this really depends on my mood. If I just need to make a small, fast edit, I'll use vim from the command line. If I'm working with Common Lisp at all, again, emacs (this time in Evil mode) is the tool of choice. If I'm doing major work, Sublime Text has been amazing. I don't even fully utilize all of the stuff it can do. I just really like its slick appearance and some of its capabilities, like highlighting a whole bunch of the same keyword all at once and then changing them all at once, regexp search, and a few other things it does well.

On Windows, it's pretty much all Visual Studio all the time. I know a little bit of how to get around in PowerShell, but I don't use it much. It's worth noting that the only language I get a lot of use out of on a Windows machine is C#. Sometimes I'll go through the effort of setting up a Lisp, upon which it's back to emacs (again), but usually this doesn't happen.

You may have noticed that unless I'm on Windows, I'm not using a dedicated IDE. Yes, I know vim and emacs both can be made to be very much their own IDE, but I haven't done that yet. It's not from a lack of trying. I certainly find myself in Visual Studio often enough, and I tried Eclipse for a few months, as well as XCode. The problem with all these tools is that I don't really want to learn a new tool. I get frustrated by starting a new project in an IDE. Also, Eclipse was really, really slow on my Mac for reasons I didn't investigate.

Also, part of me absolutely loves only relying on tools which are almost universally accessible. Sit me down in front of any given Mac or Linux box, and I can code, without feeling frustrated about my favorite tool not being available. That's -neat-.

It's worth noting that almost all of my work to date involves either command line apps, or a handful of OpenGL programs using SDL. If I was to do more work which required frameworks, or which had to talk to a specific platform's GUI API, I would probably pretty quickly adapt to using an IDE. In particular, I've played with QT Creator in the past, and I really liked that.

What are the benefits to my workflow, if any? Well, it works for me, and I can work pretty fast this way. Which should really be the goal of any work environment. If it lets you do the work you need to do, it's a good work environment.
